- **Responsive Tests**: Multi-device layout and interaction testing
- **Test Location**: apps/web/src/components/dashboard/**tests**/ and .test.tsx files

### Security and Authentication

Dashboard must integrate with existing authentication system:

- **Protected Routes**: Middleware-based authentication for dashboard access
- **User Context**: Integration with existing authStore from previous stories
- **Session Management**: Proper handling of authentication state changes
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for authentication failures

### Project Structure Notes

The dashboard implementation should build upon the existing authentication system from Story 1.2 and utilize the database schema from Story 1.3. The component structure follows the established frontend architecture patterns with proper separation of concerns between layout, content, and state management.
