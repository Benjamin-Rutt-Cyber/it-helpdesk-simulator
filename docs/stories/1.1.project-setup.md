## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md] The project uses a modern tech stack with:

- **Monorepo:** Turborepo 1.10+ for build orchestration and intelligent caching
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14.2+ with App Router, TypeScript 5.3+, Tailwind CSS 3.3+, shadcn/ui 0.8+
- **Backend:** Node.js 20.11+ LTS, Express.js 4.18+, TypeScript 5.3+
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15+ with ACID compliance for user data
- **Testing:** Jest 29.7+ with Testing Library for frontend, Supertest for backend APIs, Playwright 1.40+ for E2E

[Source: architecture/repository-structure.md] The monorepo structure enables efficient code sharing between frontend and backend while maintaining clear boundaries. Turborepo provides optimal build caching and development experience.

[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md] Backend structure follows:

```
apps/api/src/
├── controllers/     # HTTP request handlers
├── services/        # Business logic services
├── models/          # Data models and schemas
├── repositories/    # Data access layer
├── middleware/      # Express middleware
├── routes/          # API route definitions
├── utils/           # Utility functions
├── config/          # Configuration
└── app.ts           # Express app setup
```

### Database Schema Context

[Source: architecture/database-schema.md] Core database tables that will be needed:

- **users:** UUID primary key, email (unique), password_hash, profile fields, level, xp, timestamps
- **scenarios:** UUID primary key, title, description, difficulty enum, estimated_time, xp_reward, JSONB fields for ticket_template, customer_persona, knowledge_base_entries, assessment_criteria
- **user_sessions:** UUID primary key, user_id FK, scenario_id FK, status enum, timestamps, JSONB for chat_history, performance_data, verification_status
- **Database indexes:** Optimized for performance on frequently queried fields like users.email, user_sessions.user_id

### Data Models Context

[Source: architecture/data-models.md] TypeScript interfaces defined for:

- **User:** id (UUID), email, passwordHash, profile object, level (number), xp (number), timestamps, navigation properties for sessions/achievements/metrics
- **Scenario:** id (UUID), title, description, difficulty enum, estimatedTime, xpReward, ticketTemplate object, customerPersona object, knowledgeBaseEntries array, assessmentCriteria object
- **UserSession:** id (UUID), userId, scenarioId, status enum, timestamps, chatHistory array, performanceData object, verificationStatus object

### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md] Testing requirements:

- **Frontend Testing:** Jest 29.7+ with Testing Library for React component testing
- **Backend Testing:** Jest 29.7+ with Supertest for Express.js API testing
- **E2E Testing:** Playwright 1.40+ for end-to-end testing of complex user flows
- **Test Location:** Follow standard conventions - **tests** directories or .test.ts/.spec.ts files
- **Coverage:** Comprehensive testing for all components, services, and API endpoints

### Project Structure Requirements

No specific project structure guidance found beyond the monorepo setup with Turborepo and the backend architecture pattern defined above.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-07-17

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Excellent foundation implementation** - The developer has successfully created a comprehensive development environment following all architectural guidance. The monorepo structure is properly configured with Turborepo, all core dependencies are correctly installed, and the project structure aligns with the specified backend architecture pattern.

### Refactoring Performed

As part of my senior developer review, I made several improvements to enhance code quality and maintainability:

- **File**: `apps/web/.eslintrc.js`
  - **Change**: Fixed ESLint configuration to remove missing TypeScript dependencies and added Jest environment
  - **Why**: Original config referenced '@typescript-eslint/recommended' without proper installation, causing linting failures
  - **How**: Simplified to use Next.js core-web-vitals rules with Jest globals, ensuring reliable linting

- **File**: `apps/api/src/middleware/errorHandler.ts` (NEW)
  - **Change**: Added comprehensive error handling middleware with structured error responses
  - **Why**: Improves API consistency and debugging capabilities by providing standardized error responses
  - **How**: Created ApiError interface, centralized error handling, and consistent JSON error format

- **File**: `apps/api/src/app.ts`
  - **Change**: Enhanced API endpoints with consistent response format and proper error handling
  - **Why**: Ensures all API responses follow the same structure, improving frontend integration
  - **How**: Added success flags, structured responses, try-catch blocks, and proper error middleware registration

- **File**: `apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx`
  - **Change**: Fixed React import issue for ReactNode type
  - **Why**: Resolved ESLint error and improved type safety
  - **How**: Added explicit ReactNode import from 'react' instead of using React.ReactNode

- **File**: `apps/api/src/__tests__/app.test.ts`
  - **Change**: Enhanced test suite with additional test cases and updated assertions
  - **Why**: Improved test coverage and validation of error handling functionality
  - **How**: Added 404 error handling test and updated assertions to match new response format

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ All code follows TypeScript best practices and consistent formatting
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Perfect alignment with specified backend architecture pattern in Dev Notes
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage with Jest for both frontend and backend
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria fully satisfied with proper validation
