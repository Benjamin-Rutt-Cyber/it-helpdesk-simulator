# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Enable aspiring IT professionals to gain legitimate, resume-worthy helpdesk experience through realistic simulation
- Provide measurable performance data that reduces hiring risk for employers and validates candidate competency
- Create a sustainable B2C-to-B2B business model starting with individual subscriptions and evolving to enterprise verification services
- Build the foundation for becoming the recognized standard for IT support experience validation
- Deliver authentic learning experiences that bridge the "experience paradox" in IT hiring

## Background Context

The IT industry faces a critical hiring paradox where entry-level positions require 1-2 years of experience, yet candidates cannot acquire this experience without employment. Current alternatives (volunteering, self-hosted labs, online courses, certifications) fail to provide the authentic, measurable experience that employers value. Our comprehensive brainstorming and market analysis revealed that users desperately need EXPERIENCE on their resumes, not another certificate, and that companies absorb significant hidden costs from hiring inexperienced IT support staff.

The hybrid B2C-to-B2B strategy addresses this by starting with individual users ($15 AUD/month) while collecting success metrics that will naturally attract employers seeking validated candidates. This approach balances achievable market entry with high-value enterprise potential.
