# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The interface shall prioritize user confidence building through progressive difficulty and clear performance feedback.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Progressive Disclosure:** Show only necessary information at each step to prevent cognitive overload
- **Contextual Help:** Provide assistance when needed without making the interface feel like a training tool
