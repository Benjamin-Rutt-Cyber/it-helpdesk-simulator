# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the IT Helpdesk Simulator, including both backend systems and frontend implementation. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack while supporting the core learning loop: receive ticket → chat with customer → verify identity → research → resolve/escalate → receive feedback → gain XP → level up.

This unified approach combines backend services for AI conversation management, real-time chat, and performance analytics with a professional frontend that replicates authentic helpdesk software experiences.
