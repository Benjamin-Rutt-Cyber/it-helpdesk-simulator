**Structure:** Monorepo with Turborepo  
**Monorepo Tool:** Turborepo 1.10+  
**Package Organization:** Feature-based packages with shared utilities

**Rationale:** The monorepo structure enables efficient code sharing between frontend and backend while maintaining clear boundaries. Turborepo provides optimal build caching and development experience. This structure supports the complex data flow between AI simulation, real-time chat, and performance tracking systems.
