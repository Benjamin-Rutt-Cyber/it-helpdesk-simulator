# Architectural Patterns

- **Jamstack Architecture:** Static site generation with serverless APIs and real-time services - _Rationale: Optimal performance and scalability for educational content with dynamic real-time interactions_

- **Event-Driven Communication:** WebSocket events for real-time chat with message queuing - _Rationale: Enables authentic conversational experience with reliable message delivery_

- **Repository Pattern:** Abstract data access logic with transaction management - _Rationale: Enables testing and supports complex performance analytics queries_

- **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS):** Separate read/write paths for performance data - _Rationale: Optimizes real-time chat performance while supporting complex analytics_

- **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** Resilient AI API integration with fallback responses - _Rationale: Ensures system stability when AI services are unavailable_

- **Pub/Sub Pattern:** Real-time performance updates and achievement notifications - _Rationale: Supports gamification features and real-time feedback systems_
