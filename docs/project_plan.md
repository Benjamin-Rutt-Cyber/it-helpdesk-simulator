## 1. Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop a simple yet functional data analysis and visualization tool that will allow users to interact with and understand the Comprehensive Nutritional Food Database.

### 1.1 Project Objectives

This project's main objective is to develop a desktop application designed as a simple data analysis and visualization tool. This tool will be built using the provided Nutritional_Food_Database.csv, which contains detailed nutritional information for a wide range of food items. The project is structured into two key milestones:

1.1.1 Design and Planning (Milestone 1):

- Develop a comprehensive project plan, including the design of the desktop application.

- Establish a collaborative workflow using GitHub as the central repository for all project files and documentation.

- Ensure the application design includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that facilitates user interaction with the database for data analysis and visualization.

  1.1.2 Implementation and Testing (Milestone 2):

- Implement the designed application, focusing on creating a functional and user-friendly GUI.

- Integrate the required features, including:
  - <span style="color:red">Home Page/Search: A main page for the application and contains a feature that allows users to search for food items by name or term (cheese).
  - <span style="color:red">Search Results: This feature displays the search results from the food search action. This page will show a list of food items if multiple foods are found, otherwise returns the searched food item.

  - <span style="color:red">Food Page: This feature displays the nutritional information for the selected food item from the Search Results page.

  - <span style="color:red">Database Page: A feature that shows the user the entire csv file on its own page. Can be accessed through the home page.

  - <span style="color:red">Setting: A feature that allows the users to change multiple setting in the application including; Unit Preference, Theme and Language.

  - Nutrition Breakdown: A feature that provides visual representations (pie charts and bar graphs) of nutrient distribution for selected food items.

  - Nutrition Range Filter: A filtering tool that lets users specify minimum and maximum values for selected nutrients and displays foods within those ranges.

  - Nutrition Level Filter: A tool to categorize foods based on their nutritional content levels—low, mid, and high—across key nutrients like fats, proteins, and carbohydrates.

  - <span style="color:red">Food calorie calculator that allows user to add chosen food items and calculate the total number of calories.

These objectives are directly linked to the overall goal of creating a robust and interactive desktop application that facilitates data analysis and visualization of nutritional information, supporting a wide range of dietary, health, and research applications. The successful completion of these objectives will demonstrate the team’s ability to effectively manage a software development project and deliver a valuable tool for nutritional analysis.

## 4. Gantt Chart

The initial stages of the project were significantly ahead of the plan stated by the Gantt Chart. The UI was developed earlier than expecteded with lead to a good start. However the execution stage lasted longer than expected which resulted in some extensions on the timeframe for debugging the code. As a result the testing and quality assurance stage was reduced, however tests were still conducted and successful and the project was completed on time. </span>

## 5. <span style="color:red">GUI Changes

### <span style="color:red">Home Page:

- <span style="color:red">Since the frames were created. The filtered search options button was removed and in its place a button called "View Excel List" was created. This button allows the user to view the entire database.
- <span style="color:red">A calorie calculator button was added to take the user to the calorie calculator page.

### <span style="color:red">Settings Page:

- <span style="color:red">Added a back button.

### <span style="color:red">Food Page:

- <span style="color:red">Removed any images and added a grid to show the nutritional information.

### <span style="color:red">Database Page:

- <span style="color:red">A database page was created to show the entire database to the user. This was done to make it easier for users to see the kinds of foods in the database without having to search.

### <span style="color:red">Nutritional Breakdown Page:

- <span style="color:red">The nutritional breakdown page now only show two graphs and lists the top 5 nutrients of the selected food instead of including an image of the food, including two bar and pie graphs and the food information.

### <span style="color:red">Nutritional Level Filter:

- <span style="color:red">Now has an option to select a nutrient instead of a food item and also select either low, medium or high, and search for foods that contain the filter (i.e Protien, High - shows foods with high amounts of protein)

### <span style="color:red">Nutrition Range Filter:

- <span style="color:red">Added a list box to show the output of the filtered search.

### <span style="color:red">Search Results:

- <span style="color:red">Removed the 'Filtered search options' button under the search bar and instead of showing the food list in the form of images only the names of food is show.
